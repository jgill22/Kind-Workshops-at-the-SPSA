# Kind-Workshops-at-the-SPSA
Workshop files This is a repository for various files connected to ongoing workshops that I give for the Kind Institute from Montreal, eh. It gets replenished usually in December prior to activities at the SPSA meeting in January where it is conducted. Puerto Rico es asombroso. Kerry and Mebs are great too. You should look at the workshops they offer.
